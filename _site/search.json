Forking a repository creates a copy that belongs to you.1 This is what you want to do, for example, if you want to make some changes to an R package that someone else has written. You don’t have the ability to change the original repository, but you can pull any future changes the owner makes so that yours is always up to date, and you can ask them to pull in to their version any changes that you make (a pull request).\nOn your fork of the repository, click the green “Code” button. We are going to clone the repository to your computer using HTTPS. HTTPS should already be underlined, but if, not, select it. Copy the URL (this should have your username, not mine!).\n\nOpen up RStudio. Go to File &gt; New Project. Choose “Version Control” then “Git” on the next page.\n\nPaste the URL you copied earlier. You can name the project directory whatever you want, but I find it’s easiest if it has the same name as the repo. Then choose where you want to store the project.2 You can browse the file system on your computer to do so. For me, this will create the folder /Users/l.smith/Documents/Teaching/Emory/epi590r-in-class/ and everything in the repo will be downloaded to that folder. Write down this path somewhere if you can’t remember it, so you can find it later!\nYou can select “Open in new session” if you have already been doing something in R and want to keep that other RStudio window open. Then “Create Project”.\n\nFrom the filepane in RStudio, open README.md. Write your name in the file and save.\nIn your Git pane, you’ll see that file pop up because it has been modified (M). When you click on the checkbox, you are staging the file.3 Then click “Commit”.\n\nYou’ll see a diff of the changes you made to that file. If you don’t like them, you can revert. Add a commit message to explain what changes you’ve made. Then “Commit”, close the new window that opens, and then “Push”.4\n\nGo back to your web browser to check your repo! What do you notice?"

This time, choose “New Directory” and then “New Project”.\n\nChoose a name for your new project and where to store it. Check “Create a git repository.” You can leave “Use renv with this project” unchecked (for now!).\n\nLook at the git pane. What do you notice compared to the first time we looked at this pane? Stage and commit the files (I usually use “initial commit” as my first commit message since I haven’t don’t anything yet!). You’ll notice the “Push” button is grayed out – we’ll have to fix that!\n\nOpen up your web browser to GitHub. There are a few different ways to make a new repository; click one of them.\n\nFrom github.comFrom github.com/username\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a name (preferably one that matches the name you gave your R project). You can also add a description and choose to make it private, if you wish. (If private, you’ll have to invite the teaching team as collaborators so we can grade it!) You don’t need to click anything else.\n\nGitHub is going to give you some options for code. You’re going to use the second option: “push an existing repository from the command line” because you’ve already initialized the repo in RStudio. You are going to run this code in the terminal. You’ll find that in a tab next to the console.\n\n\n\nEven though it looks like you can copy and paste the 3 lines of code at once, you can’t! You’ll get the error you see above (I do this every time). Instead, copy and paste and run them one at a time. Then refresh your GitHub page!\nCreate a new file called secret.txt (you can do this via File &gt; New File &gt; Text file, then save the file). Write down your deepest, darkest secrets in there.\nUh oh! It shows up in the git pane. You don’t want to accidentally commit this to your repo!\nOpen .gitignore via the RStudio filepane.1 Add “secrets.txt” below the files that RStudio helpfully ignored for you. Then save. What happened in the git pane?\n\nWhenever you have something that shouldn’t be shared with the world, like a password or a dataset, you should add it to the .gitignore. There are a lot of examples here of how you can match folders and file patterns.\nSet up your folders how you’d like in your repo. For example, along with an R folder and a data folder, I like to have a documents folder. Find some data online, download it, and store it in your data folder. Commit and push to GitHub!\nSome fun options for data are:\n\nhttps://data.fivethirtyeight.com/\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#datasets\nhttps://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata/tree/master/data (descriptions: https://higgi13425.github.io/medicaldata/#list-of-datasets)"

Small-group work will give you the opportunity to ask and answer questions with classmates. Participation includes showing a classmate how to solve a problem (not just doing it for them), asking a classmate or me for help and describing the initial steps to solve the problem, and sharing solutions with the whole class.\nFinal project: The final project will provide an opportunity to bring together the skills you have learned in class and will be due after the course (tentative due date August 29). The project will consist of a reproducible, real-world epidemiologic analysis. The goal of the analysis will be the process and workflow rather than the scientific process or conclusions.
