    "text": "Overview\nHaving a solid R workflow is incredibly important for efficient and reproducible data analysis. It involves key practices like using R projects, leveraging the {here} package, and restarting the R session regularly. R projects provide a structured and isolated environment, ensuring project-specific settings and fostering collaboration. The {here} package simplifies file path management, boosting code portability across different systems, and saving you from the headaches of dealing with setwd(). Additionally, restarting the R session helps eliminate potential issues and ensures a clean workspace, reducing errors and allowing you to start fresh with your code execution.\n\n\nSlides\nOpen the slides in a new tab here.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nCreate an R project for this workshop (you do want to check off “Use renv” – we’ll get to that later)\nInstall the {here} package\nDownload the .csv file at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louisahsmith/reproducible-epi-workshop-2023/main/data/nlsy.csv\nCreate a data folder within your R project directory and move the nlsy.csv file there.\nRun here::here(\"data\", \"nlsy.csv\") and see what file path prints out.

    "title": "Package management with {renv}",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\n{renv} is a package management tool for R that helps you create isolated and reproducible R environments. It allows you to specify the exact versions of R packages that your project depends on, ensuring that your code runs consistently across different environments.\nWith {renv}, you can create a project-specific library of packages, which are separate from your global R library. This allows you to have different versions of packages for different projects and ensures that your project dependencies are self-contained. {renv} also provides tools for managing and resolving package dependencies, making it easier to collaborate with others and share your code.\nTo use {renv} in your projects, set up the project environment by running renv::init(). This command creates an renv.lock file, which specifies the exact versions of packages needed for the project. Other people can then replicate the environment by running renv::restore() using the renv.lock file.\n\n\nSlides\nOpen the slides in a new tab here.\nDownload the slides as a new pdf here.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\nDownload the renv.lock file here.\n\n\nIf it downloads a file, navigate to your R project in your computer file system and replace the renv.lock file that’s already there with this new one.\nIf it opens in the web browser, copy all the text and paste over the renv.lock file that’s already in your R project.\n\n\nIn your R project, run renv::restore().\nInstall a new R package of your choice. (Not sure what to choose? Try one of these fun packages. For example, I did install.packages(\"hadley/emo\").)\nCreate an R script and save it in your R project. Include some code that requires the package. For example:\n\n\nemo::ji(\"banana\")\n\n\nRun renv::status() to make sure your project picked up the package as a dependency.\nRun renv::snapshot() to record that package in your lockfile.\nOpen your lockfile and look for your new package. For example, mine now has:\n\n\"emo\": {\n      \"Package\": \"emo\",\n      \"Version\": \"0.0.0.9000\",\n      \"Source\": \"git\",\n      \"RemoteType\": \"git\",\n      \"RemoteUrl\": \"https://github.com/hadley/emo\",\n      \"RemoteHost\": \"api.github.com\",\n      \"RemoteUsername\": \"hadley\",\n      \"RemoteRepo\": \"emo\",\n      \"RemoteRef\": \"master\",\n      \"RemoteSha\": \"3f03b11491ce3d6fc5601e210927eff73bf8e350\",\n      \"Requirements\": [\n        \"R\",\n        \"assertthat\",\n        \"crayon\",\n        \"glue\",\n        \"lubridate\",\n        \"magrittr\",\n        \"purrr\",\n        \"rlang\",\n        \"stringr\",\n        \"utils\"\n      ],\n      \"Hash\": \"eb32b8f0bb50621ad498f5d836b546a4\"\n    },\n\n\nResources\n\n{renv} documentation"

Students should also create accounts on Github. Instructions for doing so and a brief activity to confirm installation will be communicated prior to the course, and I will be available via email to troubleshoot installation problems.\nIn-class activities: The bulk of the course content will be covered over the course of two daylong sessions consisting of lectures interspersed with individual and group work.\nParticipation: In-class participation consists not only of volunteering answers and/or asking questions during lectures, but also interacting with peers in small-group sessions. Small-group work will give you the opportunity to ask and answer questions with classmates. Participation includes showing a classmate how to solve a problem (not just doing it for them), asking a classmate or me for help and describing the initial steps to solve the problem, and sharing solutions with the whole class.\nFinal project: The final project will provide an opportunity to bring together the skills you have learned in class and will be due after the course (tentative due date August 29). The project will consist of a reproducible, real-world epidemiologic analysis. The goal of the analysis will be the process and workflow rather than the scientific process or conclusions. The final project will be submitted via GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMPH/MSPH Concentration Competency\nRepresentative Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilize statistical software to conduct epidemiological analysis.\nFinal project"
