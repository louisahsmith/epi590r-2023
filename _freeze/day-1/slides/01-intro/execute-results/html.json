Intense!\n    -   It will require practice afterward, and time to sink in\n    -   The goal is to set you up for success and give you resources to learn more\n-   You don't have to use everything you learn here!\n    -   Some of these tools I use for *every* project, some just occasionally\n    -   Experiment with what works for you, a little at a time\n\n## \n\n![](images/9718f461-8060-433b-b014-b294da38d172_rw_3840.png)\n\n::: aside\n[Artwork by \\@allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)\n:::\n\n## About this class\n\n-   Everything you need is at <http://epi590r-2023.louisahsmith.com>\n    -   Canvas will link you there, but good to bookmark as well\n    -   The website will be up indefinitely\n-   General format:\n    -   Some overview slides\n    -   I'll demonstrate while you watch\n    -   Practice on your own/with your classmates\n\n## Balance\n\n![](images/de7f2fcf-0f01-43bb-8580-d489c877d672_rw_3840.png)\n\n::: aside\n[Artwork by \\@allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)\n:::\n\n## About Louisa {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n-   Assistant professor at Northeastern University\n    -   Department of Health Sciences and the Roux Institute (Portland, Maine)\n-   Started using R during my master's (so almost 9 years of experience)\n    -   I learned mostly by doing!\n    -   Twitter, blogs, RStudio::conf videos, meetups\n-   Basically everything I do is in R!\n-   Actual epi research in causal inference, pregnancy, lots of other stuff\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"55%\"}\n![](images/apppic.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Most important thing about me\n\n![](images/IMG_2433.jpeg)\n\n## Why this class?\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Economics\n\n![](images/alphabetical.png)\n\n## Genes\n\n![](images/gene-names.png)\n\n## Orangutans\n\n![](images/orangutans.png)\n:::\n\n## Errors are everywhere\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n![](images/tweet1.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n![](images/tweet2.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n![](images/tweet3.png)\n:::\n:::\n\nNo one and no field is immune from errors in data analysis. Our goal is to make them as unlikely as possible (and report them when we find them!)\n\n## But also!\n\n-   It's really boring to copy lots of numbers into a table\n    -   And then change a tiny thing in the analysis and do it all over again\n-   It's really frustrating to lose work when your computer crashes, or completely change an analysis before your advisor forgets what they told you last time and has you change it back\n-   It's fun when things just work! And you get more time for the fun parts of epidemiology\n\n## \n\n![](images/483e1776-7126-4255-8e84-0557c397025f_rw_3840.png)\n\n::: aside\n[Artwork by \\@allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)\n:::\n\n## \n\n![](images/5c559781-f15a-4be9-8af0-426fcc71a9e8_rw_3840.png)\n\n::: aside\n[Artwork by \\@allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)\n:::\n\n# Questions?\n\n## Exercises: Connecting to GitHub\n\n1.  Install the `{usethis}` package:\n\n    | `install.packages(\"usethis\")`\n\n<!-- -->\n\n2.  Introduce yourself to git:\n\n    | `usethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"Louisa Smith\", user.email = \"louisahsmith@gmail.com\")`\n\nWhen you make changes to your code, they will be associated with this name and email address (this doesn't really matter for our purposes)\n\n-   You only need to do this once\n\n## Installing packages\n\nIf you just updated R to a new \"major\" version, you will need to reinstall packages\n\n-   I tend to do this as I need them rather than try to reinstall them all at once\n    -   RStudio tries to help!\n\n        ![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-12%20at%2012.55.06%20PM.png)\n\n## Possible errors\n\nSpelling the package or function's name wrong, or not installing or loading the package\n\n![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-13%20at%205.46.55%20PM.png)\n\n## Using packages\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nIf you are writing a script you will save, and will use several functions from this package\n\n``` r\nlibrary(usethis)\nuse_git_config(user.name = \"Louisa Smith\", user.email = \"louisahsmith@gmail.com\"\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nIf you are just running some quick code in the console or only need to use the package a few times in a script\n\n``` r\nusethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"Louisa Smith\", user.email = \"louisahsmith@gmail.com\")\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nI try to only run `library(package)` from a script (not the console) so that there's a \"record\" of me loading the package, or else I might accidentally write code that doesn't work later\n\n## \n\nSince I don't need to run this once, I would probably run this from the console (bottom) rather than a script (top)\n\n![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-12%20at%201.03.11%20PM.png)\n\nRunning from the console is great for `install.packages()`, quick calculations, fiddling with code until you get it right, or scenarios like this -- otherwise save your code in a script!\n\n## Connect to GitHub\n\n3.  Create a github token:\n\n    | `usethis::create_github_token()`\n\nInstead of entering your password every time, this is a secure way to connect to GitHub\n\n-   If you are ever asked for your GitHub password in RStudio, you *have* to give this instead\n\n## Connect to GitHub\n\n4.  Copy the token\n\n5.  Back in R, run this code and paste your token where it says \"Enter password\":\n\n    | `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`\n\nYou can do this again whenever your token expires or you are using a different device\n\n## Exercises\n\n-   Refer back to the slides as needed\n-   Ask a classmate if you're stuck\n-   Raise your hand for the teaching team\n-   Done early? Help a friend! Read the resources section! Play around in R! Check your email!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_c135f81b\" data-warn-when=\"180\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:33%;bottom:0;margin:5%;padding:25px;font-size:3em;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">15</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">00</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n",
