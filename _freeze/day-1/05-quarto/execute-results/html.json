It allows users to seamlessly integrate code, text, and visualizations within a single document, fostering a dynamic and interactive narrative. Quarto supports multiple programming languages, including R, Python, Julia, and JavaScript, enabling cross-language interoperability. With its intuitive syntax, Quarto makes it easy to create professional-quality reports, presentations, and articles, where code chunks can be executed on-demand and their outputs automatically updated.\n\n# Slides\nOpen the slides in a new tab [here](../slides/quarto.html){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n<div>\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"../slides/quarto.html\"></iframe>\n```\n\n</div>\n\n# Exercises\n\n1. In your R project, create a quarto document. Choose html output for now.\n2. Render the document using the Render button at the top of the RStudio pane.\n3. Change to `format: docx` in the header and re-render.\n4. Change back to `format: html` (I find easier to work on this way, can render to Word at the end).\n5. Create a code chunk with the following code and render:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnlsy <- read.csv(here::here(\"data\", \"nlsy.csv\"))\nhead(nlsy)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Resources\n\n- The [quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) is an amazing resource\n- Feel free to look at the [source code](https://github.com/louisahsmith/reproducible-epi-workshop) of this site\n\nAdditional resources for R Markdown will have a lot of overlap:\n\n-   [The Definitive Guide to R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)\n-   [The R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)\n",
