## What is `quarto`?

::: {style="height: 0px;"}
{{< include ../www/_scss.qmd >}}
:::

-   Open-source document format and computational notebook system.
-   Integrates Markdown for text and code execution in R (and other languages!)
-   Easily generate and re-generate a quarto document to produce a professional-looking document

## Why not R Markdown?

Only because quarto is newer and more featured!

-   Anything you already know how to do in R Markdown you can do in quarto, and more![^1]
-   All of these slides, website, etc. are all made in quarto.
-   If you know and love R Markdown, by all means keep using it!

[^1]: Slight caveat about a bug that we will see later...

## Quarto basics

# My title

Some text

Some *italic text*

Some **bold text**


```{{r}}
x <- 3

```{r}

## Chunk options

Some of the ones I find myself using most often:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: false
#| error: true
#| cache: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
x <- 3
```

Also `echo` (can't include above because it conflicts with my slide options!)

## Chunks can produce figures or tables

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: tbl-one
#| tbl-cap: "This is a great table"
knitr::kable(mtcars)
```

## Chunks can produce figures or tables

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: fig-hist
#| fig-cap: "This is a histogram"
hist(rnorm(100))
```

## Cross-referencing

You can then refer to those with `@tbl-one` and `@fig-hist` and the Table and Figure ordering will be correct (and linked)

::: larger-code
```         
@fig-hist contains a histogram and @tbl-one a table.
```
:::

gets printed as:

@fig-hist contains a histogram and @tbl-one a table.

## Inline R

I often create a list of stats that I want to report in a manuscript:

```{r}
#| eval: false
stats <- list(n = nrow(data),
              mean_age = mean(data$age))
```

I can then print these numbers in the text with:

```{r}
#| echo: false
stats <- list(n = 1123,
              mean_age = 43.5)
```

There were `` `r knitr::inline_expr("stats$n")` `` participants with a mean age of `` `r knitr::inline_expr("stats$mean_age")` ``.

which turns into:

There were `r stats$n` participants with a mean age of `r stats$mean_age`.

## Conclusion

There are \~1 billion other features to know about quarto.

The [website](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) is an amazing resource.
