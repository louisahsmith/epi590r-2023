## Exercises

1.  Download the `.R` script [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louisahsmith/epi590r-in-class/757acd5d2a9507e8eec1eb365c0cc1a16233f1d8/R/clean-data-bad.R) and the `.csv` file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louisahsmith/epi590r-in-class/757acd5d2a9507e8eec1eb365c0cc1a16233f1d8/data/raw/nlsy.csv).

2.  In your computer file browser, find your `epi590r-in-class` repo and create an `R` folder and a `data` folder. Within the `data` folder add a `raw` folder and a `clean` folder. Put the `.csv` file in the `data/raw` folder and the script in `R` folder. Your file structure should look like this:

    ```         
    ├── epi590r-in-class.Rproj
    ├── README.md
    ├── R/
    │   ├── clean-data-bad.R
    ├── data/
    │   ├── raw/
    │   │   ├── nlsy.csv
    │   ├── clean/
    ```

3.  Return to RStudio. Look to the filepane to confirm the files are there.

4.  Look at your Git pane. What do you notice? Stage, commit, and push the changes you've made.

5.  Try to run the code, line-by-line, in `clean-data-bad.R`. What do you notice?

6.  Go to Tools \> Global Options and under General, change your settings so that they match these:

7.  Close RStudio. Open it up again by opening the `epi590r-in-class.Rproj` file in your file browser. You should have a clean environment!
