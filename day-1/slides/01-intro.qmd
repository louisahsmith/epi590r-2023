## About this class

Goal: Learn some best practices to make your life in R easier and your research more reproducible

-   Quick! Intense!
    -   It will require practice afterward, and time to sink in
    -   The goal is to set you up for success and give you resources to learn more
-   You don't have to use everything you learn here!
    -   Some of these tools I use for *every* project, some just occasionally
    -   Experiment with what works for you, a little at a time

No one and no field is immune from errors in data analysis. Our goal is to make them as unlikely as possible (and report them when we find them!)

## But also!

-   It's really boring to copy lots of numbers into a table
    -   And then change a tiny thing in the analysis and do it all over again
-   It's really frustrating to lose work when your computer crashes, or completely change an analysis before your advisor forgets what they told you last time and has you change it back
-   It's fun when things just work! And you get more time for the fun parts of epidemiology

# Questions?

## Exercises: Connecting to GitHub

1.  Install the `{usethis}` package:

    | `install.packages("usethis")`

<!-- -->

2.  Introduce yourself to git:

    | `usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "Louisa Smith", user.email = "louisahsmith@gmail.com")`

When you make changes to your code, they will be associated with this name and email address (this doesn't really matter for our purposes)

-   You only need to do this once

## Installing packages

If you just updated R to a new "major" version, you will need to reinstall packages

-   I tend to do this as I need them rather than try to reinstall them all at once
    -   RStudio tries to help!

        ![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-12%20at%2012.55.06%20PM.png)

## Possible errors

Spelling the package or function's name wrong, or not installing or loading the package

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-13%20at%205.46.55%20PM.png)

## Using packages

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
If you are writing a script you will save, and will use several functions from this package

``` r
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Louisa Smith", user.email = "louisahsmith@gmail.com"
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
If you are just running some quick code in the console or only need to use the package a few times in a script

``` r
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "Louisa Smith", user.email = "louisahsmith@gmail.com")
```
:::
:::

I try to only run `library(package)` from a script (not the console) so that there's a "record" of me loading the package, or else I might accidentally write code that doesn't work later

## 

Since I don't need to run this once, I would probably run this from the console (bottom) rather than a script (top)

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-12%20at%201.03.11%20PM.png)

Running from the console is great for `install.packages()`, quick calculations, fiddling with code until you get it right, or scenarios like this -- otherwise save your code in a script!

## Connect to GitHub

3.  Create a github token:

    | `usethis::create_github_token()`

Instead of entering your password every time, this is a secure way to connect to GitHub

-   If you are ever asked for your GitHub password in RStudio, you *have* to give this instead

## Connect to GitHub

4.  Copy the token

5.  Back in R, run this code and paste your token where it says "Enter password":

    | `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`

You can do this again whenever your token expires or you are using a different device

## Exercises

-   Refer back to the slides as needed
-   Ask a classmate if you're stuck
-   Raise your hand for the teaching team
-   Done early? Help a friend! Read the resources section! Play around in R! Check your email!

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
countdown::countdown(
  minutes = 15,
  warn_when = 60*3,
  right = "33%",
  padding = "25px",
  margin = "5%",
  font_size = "3em",
  color_warning_background = "#ebcb8b",
  color_text                = "black",
  color_running_background  = "#8fbcbb",
  color_running_text        = "#eceff4",
  color_finished_background = "#bf616a",
  color_finished_text       = "#eceff4"
)
```
